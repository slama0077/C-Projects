This program finds the common data set between two files, sorts the common data set, and outputs it. It accepts 4 command line arguments.
Argument 1 is either "i" or "s", arguments 2 and 3 are the names of input files. If argument 1 is "i", then data in both files must be integer values. 
But if argument 1 is "s", the data will be strings. This program will write to standard out all the data that appear in both input files. The output data will be 
in ascending order, both for integers and strings. A value will be in output only once, regardless of how many times it appears.

A pair of input files containing strings is added as test vector files in this folder. More explanations about code and optimization is done in the coding file itself.
