This project uses linked lists to maintain contacts and their information. This project consists of three files:

1) main.cpp - user interacts with this program to give commands
2) p3.h - definition of different classes that have been used to complete the project
3) p3.cpp - Implementation of the classes declared in p3.h

Please use help command to get a list of valid commands. More explanation about each files and their code is done in the coding files.

A testvector file is also added. To speedup testing, all commands can be intered in an input file and redirect the program input from the file using:
./a.out <test1.txt
