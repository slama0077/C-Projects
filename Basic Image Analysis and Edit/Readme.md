A picture is made up of small pixels. Each pixel has three sub-elements which represents the intensity of three fundamental colors: red, blue, and green.

This folder has three files image.h, image.c, main.c. And with the code in these files, a user can do simple picture edits like rotate, flip, enlarge, shrink,
and crop. More explanation about the code is done in the coding file itself.
