This program contains a library for Binary Searh Tree with different addittional functionalities like pre-order, in-order, and postorder.
The actual coding file contains both class of data structures and main. The main is added just to test some vector cases and make the program user-friendly.


To interact with the program using the main, user must have a test vector file, which should be passed as a command line argument 
(test vector will be provided in the folder). Any primitive data type can be used in this library. If the file is being used with main, the data type must be changed by the user according to the data type they want to work with.

Addittional information about the code will be provided in the coding file itself.
